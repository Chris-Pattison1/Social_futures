  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I work at the intersection of social strategy, creator ecosystems, and platform-first thinking — helping brands navigate how culture, commerce, and community now collide inside feeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    My focus is on turning social culture into commercial advantage through creator-led models, future-facing insight, and measurable growth frameworks.

  <h2>The Social Landscape in 2026</h2>
  <p>
    Social media has become the cultural heartbeat of our digital lives — outpacing traditional media, reshaping commerce and redefining trust and authenticity.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social bigger than TV:</strong> Platforms like TikTok, Instagram and YouTube now dominate daily engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>Nostalgia & authenticity:</strong> “2026 is the new 2016” reflects a shift back toward genuine expression.</li>
    <li><strong>Creator economy:</strong> Creator ad spend is growing 4x faster than traditional media.</li>
    <li><strong>Search + commerce:</strong> Social platforms are now discovery engines and marketplaces.</li>
    <li><strong>Trust & wellbeing:</strong> Regulation and responsibility are front-stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Community over polish:</strong> Human, conversational content wins.</li>
  </ul>
